劇情："Traditionally, power was what was seen, what was shown, and what was manifested (...) Disciplinary power, on the other hand, is exercised through its invisibility; at the same time it imposes on those whom it subjects a principle of compulsory visibility. In discipline, it is the subjects who have to be seen. Their visibility assures the hold of the power that is exercised over them. It is this fact of being constantly seen, of being able always to be seen, that maintains the disciplined individual in his subjection" Michel Foucault, 𝘋𝘪𝘴𝘤𝘪𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘗𝘶𝘯𝘪𝘴𝘩: 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘉𝘪𝘳𝘵𝘩 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘗𝘳𝘪𝘴𝘰𝘯 演：豬文、Alex、老師編：豬文製：救助荼毒室拍攝團隊
