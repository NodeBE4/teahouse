On 10/27 Friday, Universal Studios will release the film “Sight” in theaters across the U.S.! The movie is based on Dr. Ming Wang’s autobiography “From Darkness to Sight”. The messages are freedom, faith and common ground. The film has received two major ICVM awards, for best picture and best theatrical release movie. It also made history for being the first Christian film about a Chinese American. SIGHT, starring Oscar-nominated and Emmy-winning Greg Kinnear and Terry Chen (Almost Famous, Falling), is based on the true story of Dr. Ming Wang, a poor Chinese immigrant, who defies all odds to become a world-renowned eye surgeon in the United States. This in depth interview with Dr. Wang reveals his motivation of telling his story as a first generation immigrant who constantly seeks common ground between East and West, past and present, science and faith. It is Dr. Wang’s wish that his own experience can inspire others to see beyond our human limitations and find the true light in our hearts.
