The Americas were the last continents that humans discovered and moved into. The timing of their arrival, the number of different waves of people that dispersed across the New World, as well as the routes they took as they moved south are all big questions that have fired the imaginations of archaeologists, biologists, anthropologists, and historians for decades. The general paucity of remains has meant that each new find, from Kennewick Man to Anzick has spurred tremendous interest and new theories. Recent radiocarbon dating programs and ancient DNA approaches have begun to build a more complete picture of how not just people, but also their dogs arrived into the Americas, where they went, and what is the relationship between these people and modern Native American groups. Join Tom Higham and Greger Larson from the School of Archaeology to explore the latest research into the deep past of the Americas, and what it tells us about the modern world.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xWYZxv7SzQ******明镜火拍：今天大新闻，专访评论，欢迎订阅https://www.youtube.com/c/mingjinghuopai/featured請訂閱明鏡歷史台：https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKt9OVBD71w4eGQEkLdn6NA明镜历史台是专门探寻真相的频道，我们欢迎您订阅、推介，也期待您的赞助。史学专家正一个个进驻明镜历史台，我们欢迎您成为节目主讲人，您也可以录制节目传给我们：发表您对历史事件的见解。********激赏明镜：https://www.paypal.me/huopai明镜新闻网https://www.mingjingnews.com六度新闻https://www.6do.news
