年龄48岁的翻砂工王大东被同村的一位八十岁老妇状告到警察局，告她遭到王大东强奸。王大东被捕后被挂强奸犯牌子，押上卡车沿万人簇拥的大街游行示众，直至公开审判现场……事后不过几日，检察院又宣布王大东强奸罪不成立而释放。出狱后的王大东遭到世人白眼歧视，家庭亦妻离子散。被赶出家门流落于世。此后的21年里，王大东为自己的冤案四处奔走呼号，没有结果。却最终被定性为滋事分子上了“红色通缉令”名单。当年以法的名义整治他的恶人如今退休、调离、升迁等都离开了当地。王大东却以自身一付古稀老躯仍然奔波在鸣冤的不归之途……王大东说：没有了名誉，我什么都没有了。Aged 48,  foundryman Wang Dadong was accused by an eighty-year-old lady of raping her who lived in a same village. He was soon arrested and paraded on a truck with a sign that said "Rapist". Thousands of people gathered along the street.  Police declared Wang a rapist in a public rally and detainded him in prison... A few days later, procuratorate acquitted Wang of the charge. After his release, he sufferd from people's discrimination, family disruption and got kicked out of his clan. In the next 21 years, Wang has been on the run trying to redress this fabricated case and rehabilitate his reputation, but all his efforts were for nothing. Now, his name is on the "Red Notice" of trouble-makers. Those who fabricated this case have been retired, transferd or promoted. But Wang is still on his endless way of seeking justice."Lost my reputation, I lost everything." said Wang Dadong.
