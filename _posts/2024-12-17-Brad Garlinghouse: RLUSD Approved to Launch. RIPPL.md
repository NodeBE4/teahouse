Ripple (XRP) is launching its own stable token, RLUSD, amid record recent gains.The XRP price has maintained a steep uptrend since the token bounced off the March 2020 lows. The price has subsequently rallied more than 1,000% and has also faced a sharp bear market, losing more than 80% of its gains. Regardless of the bullish or bearish trend prevailing in the market, the XRP price held on to the lower rising trendline, which has since acted as strong support. Now that the price has moved beyond the bearish range, it is believed that the token could mark the dollar boundary at any time. In just a few hours, the price of XRP has jumped more than 20% and is aiming to reach the $3 mark at any moment. With this, the optimism around XRP has surged as the token lands up as one of the top performers compared to the last several days, largely driven by memecoins. After remaining behind the crypto market trends for a long time, the XRP price has finally triggered a bullish trend.ripple,xrp,ripple xrp,ripple price,ripple price prediction,ripple prediction,xrp price,xrp price prediction,xrp prediction,ripple news,xrp news,ripple xrp news,cryptocurrency,ripple price analysis,xrp price analysis,ripple news today,ripple today,xrp today,ripple lawsuit,ripple sec,xrp sec,ripple xrp price,ripple ceo,brad garlinghouse,ripple live,xrp live,xrp latest news,ripple analysis,xrp analysis,rlusd,rlusd launch, ripple stable
