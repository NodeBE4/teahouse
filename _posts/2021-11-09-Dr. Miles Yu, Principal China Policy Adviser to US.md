Dr. Miles Yu (余茂春博士) is a professor at United States Naval Academy and served as Principal China Policy and Planning Adviser to US Secretary of State in Trump Administration. He is very knowledgeable in US-China relation, has life experience in China, and has a profound, keen and unique strategic vision. He pointed out that the fundamentals of U.S.-China relation is "determined by the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) all-round hostility towards the United States." Prof. Yu assisted President Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo to formulate a firm and effective policy toward China, ending the United States’ naive appeasement of the CCP and mistakes of US-China policy over the years. #余茂春 #书斋夜话
